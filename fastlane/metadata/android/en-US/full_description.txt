Welcome to Paymaart, where e-payments are free for members, unleashing the power of financial inclusion in Malawi. We are not just another e-payments company; we are the pioneers of a cashless revolution. Our mission is to expedite the transition to universal e-payments by offering free e-payment services to members who pay a membership fee of less than 20 MWK per day. Since our launch in the second quarter of 2024, we have been on a nationwide expansion drive, bringing the future of payments, literally, to your fingertips.

At Paymaart, we believe in the transformational power of e-payments. We are here to make sending money to a relative or friend, or paying for what you need, faster, more secure, and more convenient than ever before. By offering free e-payment services, we are removing the constraints that have held back the adoption of e-payments in Malawi, unleashing the full potential of financial inclusion. This is the first time ever that members can use e-payment services without worrying about transaction fees.

Join us on this exhilarating journey towards a cashless society that is propelling financial inclusion, incomes, and wealth to new heights. Sign up for Paymaart today, download our mobile app, for Android or iOS, and be part of the future of payments in a stronger, wealthier Malawi.
